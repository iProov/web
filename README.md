## 🤳 Introduction

The iProov Biometrics Web SDK is the client for web browser based authentication. It can be integrated in a number of ways to support your web journeys for onboarding and authentication. You can find out more about how to use iProov Web in your [User Journeys](https://portal.iproov.com/documentation) and create [API Keys](https://portal.iproov.com/service-providers/create) on the [iProov Portal](https://portal.iproov.com/).

You will need to generate a token from your back-end to use with the iProov Biometrics Web SDK. You can use the [REST API](https://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me/docs.html) to make the relevant calls and return the token to your front-end. See the [backend section](#backend) for more details.

Check out our [example](./demo), which can be spun up with a single command, which demonstrates an example backend/frontend integration.

## ✍ Registration

You can obtain API credentials by registering on the [iProov Portal](https://portal.iproov.com/).

## 📲 Installation

The npm package `@iproov/web` allows for integration of the iProov Biometrics Web SDK. It makes use of the [Web Components](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction) APIs which are supported by most modern browsers and uses the [Polymer Project](https://www.polymer-project.org) to add support where they are not yet available.

### Script Tag

For a fast proof of concept, the simplest way to integrate iProov Web to include with a script tag using our [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iproov/web) hosted on a CDN such as [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@iproov/web) or [UNPKG](https://unpkg.com/browse/@iproov/web/).

**jsDelivr**:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@iproov/web"></script>
```

**UNPKG**:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@iproov/web"></script>
```

### NPM Package

Installing locally with npm is recommended for production installations, and works best with a bundler like Webpack, Parcel or Rollup.

#### Setup

Install the package as a dependency. You can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to do this.

```sh
yarn add @iproov/web
```

```sh
npm i @iproov/web --save
```

After you have installed the `@iproov/web` package, you can require or import it into your codebase:

```javascript
// ESM or Module Bundler:
import "@iproov/web"

// CJS style:
require("@iproov/web")
```

It's as simple as that to include the iProov Biometrics Web SDK with your project.
Now you can inject the web component where you need it using one of the [integration methods](#frontend) shown below.

## 🚀 Get started

### Backend

To make use of this SDK you will require integration with the iProov backend service. You can obtain platform credentials and read our integration guide on [portal.iproov.com](https://portal.iproov.com).

When starting an iProov transaction (or claim), you first need to generate an [enrolment](https://secure.iproov.me/docs.html#operation/userEnrolServerToken) or [verification](https://secure.iproov.me/docs.html#operation/userVerifyServerToken) token, which can be passed on page load or fetched with AJAX, then used to initialise the iProov Biometrics Web SDK on the frontend.

After receiving the result from the SDK, you must then confirm its authenticity by validating the [enrolment](https://secure.iproov.me/docs.html#operation/userEnrolValidate) or [verification](https://secure.iproov.me/docs.html#operation/userVerifyValidate) token _before_ escalating the user's privileges. This must be done from your backend and is typically invoked with a redirect, form submission or AJAX call triggered by the `passed` [event](#-events).

> ⚠️ The REST API should always be called from your backend so as to never expose your secret to your client application.
> Always call the validate API from your backend after receiving a result; never trust the result provided by the web client.

### Frontend

Once an iProov token has been generated by your backend, you should pass it as an attribute to the `<iproov-me>` element using one of the integration methods described below. After a successful iProov, the result must be validated by the backend before granting the user any privileges.

#### HTML

The simplest way to pass the token to iProov is to include it as an attribute to the `<iproov-me>` HTML tag as shown here:

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" base_url="***IPROOV_PLATFORM_URL_HERE***"></iproov-me>
```

#### JavaScript

The `<iproov-me>` element can also be injected into the page with the token:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("WebComponentsReady", function (event) {
  const iProovMe = document.createElement("iproov-me")
  iProovMe.setAttribute("token", "***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***")
  document.getElementById("your-container-id").appendChild(iProovMe)
})
```

#### jQuery

The HTML can also be injected directly onto the page as in this jQuery example:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("WebComponentsReady", function (event) {
  $("#your-container-id").append($('<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***"></iproov-me>'))
})
```

There are also the following framework specific example integrations available on the wiki:

- [Angular v10](https://github.com/iProov/web/wiki/Angular-v10)
- [React v16](https://github.com/iProov/web/wiki/React-v16)
- [Vue v2](https://github.com/iProov/web/wiki/Vue-v2)

> ℹ️ JavaScript methods are run after the **WebComponentsReady** event to ensure that the SDK is ready to be injected.

## ⚙ Options

The behaviour of the iProov Biometrics Web SDK can be altered by setting the following options as attributes of the `<iproov-me>` tag in the same way as the token.

#### Base URL

You can change the backend server you are attempting to iProov against by passing the `base_url` property. This needs to point to the same platform used for generating tokens (defaults to the EU platform if not defined). Reverse proxies are supported and a custom path to the WebSocket endpoint can be used, for example: `https://custom.domain.com/custom-path/socket.io/v2/`

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" base_url="https://eu.rp.secure.iproov.me"></iproov-me>
```

#### Assets URL

Dependencies such as fonts and web workers are loaded from our CDN at cdn.iproov.app. We recommend in production that you self-host these, and set the assets_url to reflect this:

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" assets_url="https://cdn.iproov.app/assets"></iproov-me>
```

> ℹ️ [Full wiki page on assets_url and hosting assets](https://github.com/iProov/web/wiki/Serving-Assets-And-CORS)

#### Logo

You can use a custom logo by simply passing a relative link, absolute path or data URI to your logo. We recommend providing a logo in SVG format, but any web format is supported. If you don't pass a logo, the iProov logo will be shown by default. If you do not want a logo to show pass the `logo` attribute as `null`.

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" logo="https://www.iproov.com/images/iproov_logo.svg"></iproov-me>
```

#### Custom Title

Specify a custom title to be shown. Defaults to show an iProov-generated message. Set to empty string "" to hide the message entirely. You can also pass in `%@` characters which will be mapped in this order to `type` (Enrol or Verify), `user_name` (the user_name you passed when generating the token), `sp_name` (the service provider you used to generate the token).

> ⚠️ iProov-generated messages are passed through our translators. If you pass a custom title, you must provide the translated version.

```html
<!-- Set the title to a plain string -->
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" custom_title="iProov Ltd" />

<!-- Hide the title, empty string, "null" or "false" can be used. Must be a string! -->
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" custom_title="" />

<!-- Build dynamic string with type, user_name and sp_name-->
<!-- i.e. Below would generate "Enrol AS andrew@iproov.com TO iProov" -->
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" custom_title="%@ AS %@ TO %@" />
```

#### Colours

You can customise the look and feel of the main layout by changing the following options. You can pass a literal value i.e. `red`, RGB i.e. `rgb(230, 245, 66)` or a hex value i.e. `#e6f542`.

```javascript
loading_tint_color = "#5c5c5c" // The app is connecting to the server or no face found. Default: grey (#5c5c5c)
not_ready_tint_color = "#f5a623" // Cannot start iProoving until the user takes action (e.g. move closer, etc). Default: orange (#f5a623)
ready_tint_color = "#01bf46" // Ready to start iProoving. Default: green (#01bf46)
liveness_tint_color = "#1756e5" // Liveness tint colour. Default: blue (#1756e5)
```

The example below changes the default grey no face to `#4293f5` (blue), giving feedback like "Move Closer" to red `rgb(245, 66, 66)` and starting to `purple`.

```html
<iproov-me
  token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***"
  loading_tint_color="#4293f5"
  not_ready_tint_color="rgb(245, 66, 66)"
  ready_tint_color="purple"
></iproov-me>
```

#### CSP Nonce

Set the `csp_nonce` option to a random string to avoid requiring `unsafe-inline` in your style-src CSP.

Note that inline CSS _is_ needed to provide critical styles for `<iproov-me>` for immediate user interaction.

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" csp_nonce="P5wB82PFZt"></iproov-me>
```

#### Allow Landscape

When `allow_landscape` is set to `false`, all handheld devices except Android tablets will be prevented from starting in landscape orientation. The iProov component will display the `rotate_portrait` slot when in landscape.

By default, all devices are allowed in landscape orientation.

See [slots](#-slots) for details on how to override the `rotate_portrait` slot. The example below would prevent all devices from being able to iProov while in landscape orientation.

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" allow_landscape="false"></iproov-me>
```

Note that desktop devices are unaffected by `allow_landscape`. Android based tablet devices are exempt due to the common position of their camera.

#### Show Countdown

By setting `show_countdown` to `true`, a countdown will be shown to the user before scanning actually starts. If this is set to `false`, when the users face becomes properly aligned the scanner will start in 2 seconds as long as the users face is still properly aligned. By default, `show_countdown` is `false`. The example below shows how to enable the countdown.

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" show_countdown="true"></iproov-me>
```

#### Enable Camera Selector

Support multiple camera selection on desktop devices by setting `enable_camera_selector` to `true`.

When enabled, the `camera_selector` slot and `multiple_cameras` event will be exposed. See [Camera Selector](#-slots) slot for customisation options. This feature is only available on desktop devices (laptops, PCs etc).

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" enable_camera_selector="true"></iproov-me>
```

#### Debug Logs

Logs at level info or lower are hidden, but can be exposed to the console by setting `debug` to `true`.
Warnings and errors will always be emitted to the console.

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" debug="true"></iproov-me>
```

This setting has no effect on any `iProovSupport` instance that's been initialised separately to the main component.

The checker itself accepts a logger argument which could be `console`, or any common logging library which you are free to configure to your own requirements.

#### Kiosk Mode

When deploying iProov on physically secured hardware such as laptops and desktop devices, you can enable the kiosk mode UI.

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***" kiosk_mode="true"></iproov-me>
```

> ℹ️ Kiosk mode will only activate on tablets and desktops. It is automatically disabled on mobile devices.

## 📥 Slots

Customise the markup, styling and automatically inherit your app's styles by [using slots](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components/Using_templates_and_slots).
You can customise the preparation and result stages of iProov to seamlessly integrate it into your application.

The following examples show different ways to customise some commonly used slots.

### HTML

The simplest way to add a slot is to include it within the `<iproov-me>` HTML tag as shown in the example below:

```html
<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***">
  <div slot="ready">
    <h1 class="iproov-lang-heading">Ready to iProov</h1>
  </div>
  <div slot="button">
    <button type="button">Scan Face</button>
  </div>
</iproov-me>
```

> ℹ️ In order to style and manipulate your slots, you can add custom classes and IDs which can be accessed from your CSS and JavaScript.

#### JavaScript

You can also build up the slots with the `<template>` element and JavaScript before injecting the Web Component:

Template to be placed anywhere in your page:
```html
<template id="iproov_template">
  <div slot="ready">
    <h1 class="iproov-lang-heading">Register your face</h1>
  </div>
  <div slot="button">
    <button>Start face scan...</button>
  </div>
</template>
```

JavaScript:
```javascript
window.addEventListener("WebComponentsReady", function (event) {
  const iProovMe = document.createElement("iproov-me")
  iProovMe.setAttribute("token", "***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***")
  const templateContent = document.querySelector("#iproov_template").content.cloneNode(true)
  iProovMe.append(templateContent)
  document.getElementById("your-container-id").appendChild(iProovMe)
})
```

With [jQuery](https://jquery.com), the entire Web Component can be injected with slots using HTML syntax, for example:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("WebComponentsReady", function (event) {
  const iProovMe = $('<iproov-me token="***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***"></iproov-me>')

  iProovMe.append('<div slot="ready"><h1 class="iproov-lang-heading">Register your face</h1></div>')
  iProovMe.append('<button type="button" slot="button">Start face scan...</button>')

  $("#your-container-id").append(iProovMe)
})
```

To integrate with our localization feature, use special class names in your slotted content:
* Headings must use `.iproov-lang-heading`
* Supplementary terms (message, reason etc) must have `.iproov-lang-term`

**Example:** The below text will be swapped with the correctly localized strings when displayed:
```html
<div slot="passed">
  <h3 class="iproov-lang-heading">Passed</h3>
  <div class="iproov-lang-term">You have iProoved successfully</div>
</div>
```

> ⚠️ When customising any the `button` and `grant_button` slots, the slot must contain a `<button>` element to ensure interactivity. These buttons may be disabled by the SDK on component load while we configure according to the passed in token.

The following is the complete list of slots can be used with the `<iproov-me>` web component and have associated [events](#-events):

| Slot                     | Description                                                                                   |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **button**               | Element that a user taps or clicks on to launch into fullscreen and start iProov              |
| **camera_selector** \*   | Label and dropdown populated with available cameras, if multiple cameras are detected.        |
| **cancelled**            | State displayed to the user when they exit fullscreen before iProoving                        |
| **error**                | State displayed to the user in the event of an error                                          |
| **failed**               | State displayed to the user when the user failed iProov                                       |

| **grant_permission**     | State displayed to the user when camera permission is unknown and not blocked                 |
| **interrupted**          | State displayed to the user when fullscreen quickly exits after launch, maybe due to software |
| **no_camera**            | State displayed to the user when there is no camera                                           |
| **passed**               | State displayed to the user when the user passed iProov                                       |

| **unsupported**          | State displayed to the user when their browser is not supported                               |

> \* Visible and managed when [camera selection](#enable-camera-selector) is enabled. A select menu with the class `iproov-camera-selector` must be present within your slots markup. An error will be thrown if this cannot be found.

> \*\* See [allow landscape](#-allow-landscape) option which controls the behaviour of the `rotate_portrait` slot and details on how to override.

## 📆 Events

There are a set of [CustomEvents](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) that can be used to integrate bespoke functionality. Events are bound directly to the `<iproov-me>` element after the `WebComponentsReady` event is called on the `window`.

### Details

Every event has a [detail](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/detail) property which contains data relating to that event. The token is present for every event:

```json
{
  "token": "Your Generated Token"
}
```

The available events are detailed below with any extra properties that are supplied:

| Event                   | Extra Properties                 | Description                                                                                               |

### Listeners

We recommend the integrator listens for at least the **ready** and **unsupported** events because one of them will always be called, so you can determine if iProov is supported or not:

```javascript
document.querySelector("iproov-me").addEventListener("ready", function (event) {
  console.log("iProov is ready")
})
document.querySelector("iproov-me").addEventListener("unsupported", function (event) {
  console.warn("iProov is not supported: " + event.detail.reason)
})
```

Because all event **details** share the same structure, they can be handled by a single function if desired:

```javascript
const iProovMe = document.querySelector("iproov-me")
iProovMe.addEventListener("ready", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("started", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("cancelled", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("interrupted", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("streaming", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("streamed", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("progress", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("passed", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("failed", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("error", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("unsupported", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("permission", iProovEvent)
iProovMe.addEventListener("permission_denied", iProovEvent)

function iProovEvent(event) {
  switch (event.type) {
    case "cancelled":
    case "interrupted":
    case "error":
    case "unsupported":
    case "permission":
    case "permission_denied":
      console.warn("iProov " + event.type + " - " + event.detail.reason)
      break
    case "progress":
      console.info(event.detail.message + " (" + event.detail.progress + "%)")
      break
    case "passed":
    case "failed":
      console.log("iProov " + event.detail.type + " " + event.type)
      break
    default:
      console.log("iProov " + event.type)
  }
}
```

If you're using [jQuery](https://jquery.com), you can attach to all the events in one go:

```javascript
$("iproov-me").on("ready started cancelled interrupted streamed progress passed failed error unsupported", iProovEvent)
```

## 🌎 Localization

The Web SDK ships with English strings by default. To provide strings in another language, you can supply `language` overrides as JSON. Language files use the same structure.

- [View the default language file with all keys and language strings](https://github.com/iProov/web/blob/master/iproov-en.json)

You can customise the language by supplying the `language` attribute to your iProov component. The `language` value must be valid JSON and passed as a string.

Any value not supplied will fall back to the English default.

### Override language strings

```javascript
window.addEventListener("WebComponentsReady", (event) => {
  const iProovMe = document.createElement("iproov-me")
  iProovMe.setAttribute("token", "***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***")

  const customLanguage = {
    "passed": "You passed!",
    "prompt_connecting": "It's loading..."
  }
  element.setAttribute("language", JSON.stringify(customLanguage))

  // inject iproov element into page
  document.getElementById("your-container-id").appendChild(iProovMe)
})
```

#### Load language file

```javascript
window.addEventListener("WebComponentsReady", async (event) => {
  async function getLanguage(path) {
    const response = await fetch(path)
    const language = await response.text()

    return language
  }

  const iProovMe = document.createElement("iproov-me")
  iProovMe.setAttribute("token", "***YOUR_TOKEN_HERE***")

  const languageFile = "" // local or external path to language file
  const customLanguage = await getLanguage(languageFile)
  element.setAttribute("language", customLanguage)

  // inject iproov element into page
  document.getElementById("your-container-id").appendChild(iProovMe)
})
```

There are also some framework specific examples on the [Angular](https://github.com/iProov/web/wiki/Angular-v10#local-language-file) and [React](https://github.com/iProov/web/wiki/React-v16#include-language-file) wiki pages.

## 🌐 Browser support

iProov's Web SDK makes use of the following technologies:

- [WebGL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGL_API)
- [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API)
- [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
- [WebComponents](https://www.webcomponents.org/introduction)

iProov Biometrics Web SDK requires access to a front facing camera, WebGL, WebAssembly and the ability to enter full screen. A network connection is required that allows WebSockets. Provided there's a suitable webcam available, most modern desktop browsers fall within these criteria.

Of the mainstream browsers that support the above technologies, we support the **last two releases**. We feature detect capabilities and provide reasonable fallbacks for older or less mainstream browsers, and only mark them as `unsupported` if we're confident that the experience won't work.

### Support checker

Developers can use the `iProovSupport` check component to ensure their users have the correct hardware and software to use the Web SDK before embedding the web component. If the user device is unsupported, the integrator can send the user down an alternative journey.

`iProovSupport` is a lightweight, separate component from the main `IProovMe` web component.
Using `iProovSupport` on a standalone basis means that consumers can code split their bundle so that users don't need to download an entrypoint that contains the full component until device support has been established.

We recommend using this pattern and splitting entrypoints on your app so that iProov is downloaded only when necessary to ensure a quick UX.

**Example usage when using a bundler that treats UMD like ESM:**
```javascript
import { iProovSupport } from "@iproov/web/iProovSupport.js"
const optionalLogger = console
const supportChecker = new iProovSupport(optionalLogger)
```

**Example usage without a bundler, inside a vanilla ES6 / ESM environment:**

```javascript
// ESM without a bundler:
import "@iproov/web/iProovSupport.js
const supportChecker = new window.iProovSupport.default()
```

**Example usage for script tag integrators in test:**

`iProovSupport` is available on the window object via `window.IProov` once included:

```javascript
const supportChecker = new window.IProov.IProovSupport()
```

`iProovSupport` can check for the required APIs on the user's browser, using either event or Promise based APIs:

#### How to use iProovSupport:

```javascript
const supportChecker = new iProovSupport()
// Event based:
supportChecker.addEventListener("check", (event) => {
  const { supported, granted, is_native_bridge } = event.detail
  if (supported === false) {
    // go to fallback UX
  }
  if (supported && granted) {
    // full permission and granted, we can definitely iProov!
    if (is_native_bridge) {
      // if native bridge mode has been detected then permission checks have been circumvented as they aren't needed
    }
  }
  if (supported && granted === null) {
    // browser API support, but we haven't run a permission check (see checkWithPermission)
  }
  if (supported && granted === false) {
    // browser API support, but camera access denied - try again or advise user before proceeding
  }
})

// Promise based:
const { supported, granted, is_native_bridge } = await supportChecker.check()
```

...or to carry out a complete lightweight check for camera access with user interaction, this can pre-set the required
permissions for iProoving, save some bandwidth, and provide a cleaner user journey if camera access isn't possible:

```javascript
const supportChecker = new iProovSupport()
document.querySelector("#check-button").addEventListener("click", async () => {
  const { supported, granted } = await supportChecker.checkWithPermission()
})
```

If `.checkWithPermission()` is executed when permission has already been granted and cached within the browser,
further permission checks are not required; we can tell if permission has been granted using a soft `.check()`.

Note that browsers have varying regimes to protect against device fingerprinting and to ensure user privacy. Repeated
calls to `getUserMedia` or the Permissions API can result in prompt blockage, or the redaction of media devices, which
can return inaccurate results. Our advice is therefore to avoid running multiple checks, in quick succession, on the
same page. Therefore, please avoid automatic or accidental repeat calls to `check` or `checkWithPermission`, especially
without user interaction.

The following events can be emitted from `iProovSupport`:

```javascript
const supportChecker = new iProovSupport()
function onCheckResult(event) {
  const {
    /** @var boolean */
    supported,
    /** @var boolean */
    granted,
    /** @var array */
    tests,
    /** @var boolean|undefined */
    is_native_bridge,
  } = event.detail
  console.debug("Checks run:", tests)
  if (supported) {
    if (is_native_bridge) {
      console.debug("User can iProov with the Native SDK")
    } else {
      console.debug("User can iProov with the Web SDK")
    }
    if (granted) {
      console.debug("User has granted permission for camera access")
    } else {
      console.debug("Prompt the user for camera access permission")
    }
  } else {
    console.error("Browser does not support the Web SDK")
  }
}
const onUnsupported = ({ supported, tests }) => ({})
const onPermissionWasGranted = ({ tests }) => ({})
const onPermissionWasDenied = ({ tests }) => ({})
supportChecker.addEventListener("check", onCheckResult)
supportChecker.addEventListener("unsupported", onUnsupported)
supportChecker.addEventListener("granted", onPermissionWasGranted)
supportChecker.addEventListener("denied", onPermissionWasDenied)
// The `tests` object consists of the following options:
// null if unchecked, true if supported, false if not supported:
const possibleTests = {
  videoInput: null,
  wasm: null,
  userMedia: null,
  mediaStreamTrack: null,
  frontCamera: null,
  fullScreen: null,
  webgl: null,
}
```

The `is_native_bridge` property will be exposed on support checker events if the checker detects that `iProovNativeBridgeInfo` exists within the global scope. This variable is injected automatically by the native SDK. In this case, the browser support and permission checks are cast to `true` as we won't be using the browser to iProov.

Using the support checker is the best and canonical way to detect whether the user's browser supports the Web SDK.

## 🕸 WebViews

The iProov Web and Native SDKs can work with WebView based apps using the [Native Bridge](#native-bridge) feature. This allows the Web SDK to seamlessly launch the native SDKs embedded within the app.

You can enable this with one line of code in your mobile app; from that point, the Web/Native SDKs take care of the rest.

Note that:

- Native Bridge mode is _mandatory_ for iOS `WKWebView` based apps until iOS 14.3, when Apple enabled support for `getUserMedia`. In all other cases, the `unsupported` event fires.
- In Android WebView apps, it _is_ possible to use the Web SDK directly provided that your app correctly allows fullscreen mode. This ensures the user interface is correctly rendered.

These WebView examples demonstrate how to ensure fullscreen is allowed and configured correctly inside your Android app:

- [Java Fullscreen WebView Example](https://github.com/iProov/android/wiki/Java-WebView)
- [Kotlin Fullscreen WebView Example](https://github.com/iProov/android/wiki/Kotlin-WebView)

## 🌉 Native bridge

If integrating iProov into a WebView based app, why not take advantage of our Native SDKs?

Native SDK integration is possible with one line of code in a single location in your app's codebase. The Web SDK then automatically detects and switches to Native Bridge mode if available.

### Native SDK integration guides

For more information on using iProov Web within a native WebView based app, see the following Wiki pages:

- [Android Native Bridge Integration Guide](https://github.com/iProov/android/wiki/Web-Native-Bridge)
- [iOS Native Bridge Integration Guide](https://github.com/iProov/ios/wiki/Native-Bridge)

### Customisation

The `native_sdk_options` setting accepts a base64 encoded JSON object of iProov Native SDK options as defined in the [iOS](https://github.com/iProov/ios#-options) and [Android](https://github.com/iProov/android#-options) documentation:

```js
iProovMe.setAttribute("native_sdk_options", btoa(JSON.stringify({ ui: { scanLineDisabled: true, filter: "classic" } })))
```

## ❓ Help & support

You may find your question answered on our [Wiki pages](https://github.com/iProov/web/wiki).

For further help with integrating the SDK, please contact [support@iproov.com](mailto:support@iproov.com).

### Known issues

- Title exceeds header on some small screens, a workaround is to use a Custom Title or hide the title completely.
- iOS WebView based browser support is currently whitelisted to those with the most support.
